# Water-End-Use-Customer-Segmentation

This repository contains the code of the **end-use based water customer segmentation analysis approach**, developed in Cominola et al. (under review) to aid the discovery of residential water end-use behaviors from water use data metered at sub-daily sampling resolution by means of single-point intelligent meters. The repository also contains the data used in Cominola et al. (under review) to test the method.

**Requirements:** 
- Matlab - The code in this repository has been developed and tested on Matlab R2018b

The following additional Matlab packages:
